## ▶️ Usage

### 🛠️ Setup

Before running the application, ensure you have Python 3.11.4 installed and the required libraries:

1.  **Install Python 3.11.4 via pyenv**:
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.11.4
    pyenv local 3.11.4
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 🚀 Running the Application

Choose the mode that best fits your needs:

#### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Recommended for most users. This launches the intuitive desktop application for manual selection and processing.
```bash
python src/main.py
```

#### 2. Advanced CLI Processing (Automated)
Recommended for power users or those wanting to leverage automated watermark detection (Florence-2) and advanced inpainting (LaMa).
```bash
python remwm_lama_florence2.py .\videos\clip-pre.mp4
```

### 🖼️ See it in action!
*(**TODO**: Insert a GIF demonstrating the application's usage here.
A short GIF showing:
1.  Opening the app.
2.  Selecting a media file (image or video).
3.  Selecting a watermark mask.
4.  Clicking "Start Processing".
5.  Showing the progress bar and stage updates.
6.  Briefly showing the output.
This will greatly enhance user understanding and engagement!)*

Once the GUI appears, follow these simple steps:
1.  **Select Watermark Template** 🏷️: Provide an image file that serves as a mask for the watermark you wish to remove. This guides the application in identifying the target.
2.  **Select Media to be Edited** 📁: Choose your target image or video file (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.mp4`, etc.).
3.  **Start Processing** ▶️: Click the dedicated "Start Processing" button.

Observe the real-time logs and dynamic progress updates. Upon completion, your watermark-free file will be conveniently saved in the same directory as your original media, clearly identified with an `_unmasked` suffix.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The **Ultimate Watermark Remover GUI** orchestrates a sophisticated, multi-stage process to achieve impeccable watermark removal:

1.  **Input & Precise Masking** 🎯: You provide both the media file and a crucial watermark template (mask). This mask is instrumental for OpenCV's inpainting algorithm, ensuring accurate identification and removal of unwanted elements.
2.  **Intelligent Video Frame Extraction** (for Videos) 🎞️: When a video file is supplied, it's meticulously broken down into its constituent frames. Each frame is then treated as an individual image for processing.
3.  **Advanced Watermark Inpainting** ✨: For every frame (or the standalone image), OpenCV's powerful inpainting algorithm is applied using the provided mask. This intelligently reconstructs the masked area based on surrounding pixel data, effectively "erasing" the watermark seamlessly.
4.  **Flawless Audio Extraction & Re-integration** (for Videos) 🎤🔗: Simultaneously, if a video is being processed, FFmpeg efficiently extracts its original audio track. Once all video frames are unmasked and reassembled into a new silent video, FFmpeg then precisely merges this pristine video stream with the preserved original audio track, ensuring perfect synchronization.
5.  **Clean Output** ✅: The final, watermark-free image or video (complete with audio, if applicable) is then saved, ready for immediate use.
